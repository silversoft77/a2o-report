## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Application overview

Below are links to the screenshots illustrating the main reports UI and conversion funnel used in this project. The images are hosted externally â€” click the links to view them.

- Reports overview (time-series job bookings): https://prnt.sc/wpO6SBnH38qs

- Conversion funnel (multi-step funnel view): https://prnt.sc/pMGTlxY9Oi0g

Summary

- Features:
	- Interactive date-range and market filters (multi-select) used to query reports from the backend.
	- Job Bookings chart: time-series areaspline showing daily bookings per market across the selected period.
	- Conversion Funnel: multi-step conversion visualization (counts + percentages) with CSV export.
	- Role-aware market access: users whose `market_ownership` is `all` see all markets; users with a comma-separated list see only those markets.
	- CSV export endpoints for report data to support offline analysis.

- Performance (short summary):
	- Backend: aggregate queries group by market and date, optimized with date-range filtering. Query cost depends on result set size; limiting markets and date windows keeps responses fast.
	- Frontend: charts are rendered client-side (Highcharts) and handle moderate series sizes (tens of markets, multi-week ranges) smoothly; large ranges or many markets may require server-side aggregation or pagination to remain snappy.

Notes
